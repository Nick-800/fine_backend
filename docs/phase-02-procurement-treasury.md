# Phase 02: Procurement, Import & Treasury

> **Duration Estimate:** 4–5 weeks  
> **Team Size:** 2 backend engineers, 1 frontend engineer  
> **Dependencies:** Phase 01 (Foundation, Auth, Units)

---

## 2.1 Objective

Build the foreign procurement pipeline from supplier order creation through multi-currency payment execution (bank hold/release or black-market exchange) to landed-cost allocation into raw-material inventory. This phase also delivers the Treasury module with FX rate capture, FX gain/loss posting, and multi-currency cash account management.

---

## 2.2 Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Supplier management CRUD | Full CRUD with contact info, default currency, history of orders |
| 2 | Import Order lifecycle | Full state machine (Draft → PendingPayment → AwaitingBankApproval/AwaitingTransfer → Paid → InTransit → AtPort → AwaitingReceipt → Received → Complete) |
| 3 | Payment Request & Bank Hold | Two-route payment execution; bank hold buffer tracking; remainder release |
| 4 | Landed Cost tracking | Discrete LandedCostLine entries per cost component (supplier price, FX spread, customs, freight, local transport) |
| 5 | Goods Receipt | Physical receipt confirmation linking to warehouse and import order |
| 6 | FX Rate capture | Snapshot on every conversion; historical rate lookup |
| 7 | FX Gain/Loss auto-posting | Journal entry auto-generated when realized rate differs from booked estimate |
| 8 | Treasury cash accounts | Multi-currency account balances; account ledger view |
| 9 | Unit client: Procurement screens | Import order creation, status pipeline, goods receipt entry |
| 10 | Unit client: Treasury screens | Payment execution, FX rate entry, cash account overview |

## 2.3 Database Migrations (This Phase)

- `suppliers`
- `import_orders`
- `payment_requests`
- `bank_holds`
- `landed_cost_lines`
- `goods_receipts`
- `fx_rates`
- `cash_accounts`

## 2.4 State Machine: Import Order

```
Draft ──[Procurement enters order]──► PendingPayment

PendingPayment ──[Treasury selects bank route]──► AwaitingBankApproval
PendingPayment ──[Treasury selects market route]──► AwaitingTransfer

AwaitingBankApproval ──[Bank approves hold]──► PaymentProcessing
PaymentProcessing ──[Bank converts & remits]──► Paid

AwaitingTransfer ──[Market exchange completed]──► Paid

Paid ──[Supplier confirms & ships]──► InTransit

InTransit ──[Goods arrive at port]──► AtPort

AtPort ──[Transport to warehouse]──► AwaitingReceipt

AwaitingReceipt ──[Warehouse checks in]──► Received

Received ──[Accounting verifies all costs settled]──► Complete
```

### Side Effects per Transition

| Transition | Side Effect |
|------------|-------------|
| `PendingPayment → *` | Creates `PaymentRequest`; notifies Treasury |
| `AwaitingBankApproval → PaymentProcessing` | Creates `BankHold`; reserves LYD buffer in `cash_accounts` |
| `PaymentProcessing → Paid` | Releases BankHold remainder; records FX rate used |
| `AwaitingTransfer → Paid` | Records FX rate at market rate |
| `InTransit → AtPort` | Adds customs/freight `LandedCostLines` |
| `AtPort → AwaitingReceipt` | Adds local_transport `LandedCostLine` |
| `AwaitingReceipt → Received` | Creates `GoodsReceipt`; increments Main Warehouse inventory (provisional value) |
| `Received → Complete` | Allocates full landed cost into raw-material valuation; posts AP settlement + landed-cost journal entries |

## 2.6 Key Business Rules

| Rule ID | Description | Enforcement |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| PROC-01 | ImportOrder currency defaults to supplier's default currency | Default in model; overridable |
| PROC-02 | Only Treasury role can execute payment routes | Policy check on PaymentRequestController |
| PROC-03 | Bank hold amount must exceed invoice converted cost (buffer) | Validation on `held_amount_lyd` field |
| PROC-04 | Landed cost lines must sum to total inventory value on completion | Auto-validation before Complete transition |
| PROC-05 | GoodsReceipt quantity must not exceed ImportOrder quantity | Validation rule |
| PROC-06 | FX rate must be captured at time of every conversion | Required field on PaymentRequest execution |
| PROC-07 | FX gain/loss posted when realized rate ≠ booked estimate | Observer on PaymentRequest status change to Paid |
| PROC-08 | ImportOrder cannot reach Complete without GoodsReceipt | State machine guard |
| PROC-09 | All landed cost components capitalized into inventory, not expensed | Journal entry template (DR Inventory, CR AP/Landed Cost Clearing) |
| PROC-10 | Soft delete only — no hard deletes on ImportOrders with payments | Model policy + observer |

---

## 2.7 Landed Cost Allocation Formula

```
landed_cost_per_unit = (
    supplier_price
    + fx_spread_cost
    + customs_cost
    + freight_cost
    + local_transport_cost
) / received_quantity

// Posted to Accounting on Complete:
DR  Raw Material Inventory (at landed_cost_per_unit × qty)
CR  Accounts Payable / Landed Cost Clearing
```

---

## 2.8 FX Gain/Loss Posting

```
booked_rate  = rate at ImportOrder creation/estimate
realized_rate = rate at PaymentRequest execution

if (realized_rate > booked_rate):
    // LYD weakened — we paid more
    DR  FX Loss (Expense)
    CR  Accounts Payable
else:
    // LYD strengthened — we paid less
    DR  Accounts Payable
    CR  FX Gain (Revenue)
```

---

## 2.9 Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests:** Landed cost calculator, FX gain/loss calculator, state machine guards
- **Feature tests:** Full import order lifecycle (Draft → Complete), bank hold buffer validation, FX posting accuracy
- **Policy tests:** Procurement cannot execute payments; Treasury cannot create import orders

---

## 2.10 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Landed cost estimation vs. actual variance | Medium | Build for estimated costs now; variance journal entries can be added in Phase 08 if needed |
| Bank API integration unavailable | High | Bank hold is a manual tracking record; no actual bank API integration in v1 — Treasury user updates status manually |
| Multi-currency complexity grows | Medium | Scope to USD⇄LYD only for v1; schema supports generic pairs but business logic targets this pair |
| Customs/freight costs unpredictable | Low | Manual entry per shipment; no formula estimation |

---

## 2.11 Open Questions to Resolve

1. **Estimated vs. confirmed landed costs:** Can ImportOrder close with estimated costs and true up later? (SRS Section 6, 18) — *Default: block Complete until all LandedCostLines are confirmed.*
2. **Multi-currency scope:** Is USD⇄LYD sufficient, or do we need a generic rate matrix? (SRS Section 7, 18) — *Default: USD⇄LYD only for v1; schema keeps generic pair fields.*
3. **Bank integration:** Is there any bank API available, or is everything manual entry? — *Assumption: manual status updates in v1.*
